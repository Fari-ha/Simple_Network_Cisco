# The Simple Network Project welcomes you!

With this creative endeavor, take a trip through the realm of effective IP address distribution. Implementing Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM), a complex subnetting approach that optimizes IP address allocation, eliminating waste and maximizing efficiency, is the foundation of this project.

# Features

Network Design: Using three routers and five LAN connections, investigate a complex network design.

VLSM Subnetting Technique: Observe how this effective IP addressing method is implemented.

Static IP Addressing:  Acknowledge the importance of static IP addressing for certain network segments.

#Implementing: 

To put this network layout into action, do the following:

Make sure Cisco Packet Tracer is set up on your computer.

Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer to examine the network and make any necessary modifications.

Understand the network architecture by looking at the configurations for the switch and router.
